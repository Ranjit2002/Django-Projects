<h1>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs
    with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be
    executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</h1>
